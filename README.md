# Color Pipes
- Connect the colored pipes

How the Game Works
-
This is a game in which you need to connect the pipes by matching one end of the pipe to another. The initial/end pipe locations are already designated. 

It is the user's responsibility to connect the colors accordingly without intersecting any other pipe. If a previously drawn/colored pipe path is overwritten, it will either erase/overwrite the pipe color. 

You need to make use of every space on the grid / every space needs to be colored.
