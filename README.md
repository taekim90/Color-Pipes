# Color Pipes
- Connect the colored pipes

How the Game Works
-
This is a game in which you need to connect the pipes by matching one end of the pipe to another. The initial/end pipe locations are already designated. 

When a user clicks on the initial colored pipe and drags their mouse, it will create a path / fill in the path with the same color of the initial pipe

It is the user's responsibility to connect the color pipes accordingly without intersecting any of the others. If a previously drawn/colored pipe path is crossed, it will erase/overwrite the previously drawn pipe color. 

You win when you make use of every space on the grid and all of the pre-set starting pipes are connected appropriately without any intersecting pipes.

MVP Checklist
- 
- A functional working game board
- Clicking and holding on the starting pipe will select that color and paint the drawn path with that held color
- Colors change appropriately when selecting a different colored pipe
- Intersecting a previously drawn pipe will cause that previous pipe to be replaced
- Game recognizes when winning condition occurs/puzzle completed (all pipes are connected accordingly and all spaces on the board are covered)
- There is no losing condition but there is a reset button to clear the marked spaces if needed
- Clicking on the different level buttons changes the board layout

Stretch Goals
-
- Add number of turns taken
- Add additional levels/ larger boards / additional numbers of colors per board
- Throw in random barriers? (images of rocks?)
